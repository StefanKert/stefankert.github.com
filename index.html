        My name is Stefan Kert. I am a Software Developer and Data Engineer. In my day to day life I like to make people´s life easier.
        I try to achieve this with different things. Maybe with a new shiny tool that let´s you automate some of the steps
        you need to do day by day or with a data analysis of the current incoming data to give you deeper knowledge about
        your customers needs.

      <p>
        I´m privileged to work in an area that is filled with some of the smartest people on our planet and therefore I really love to add
        something to make this world a better place by helping people doing their work. 
      </p>
      <p>
        From the beginning of my career I tried to get my hands into opensource and I´ve created some projects. One of the widest
        used is
        <a href="https://github.com/StefanKert/BuildVision" target="blank">BuildVision</a> which currently has more then 42k downloads! Insane!
      </p>
      <p>
        Something that I really want to do is give back something to the people that make our life so much easier day by day. Therefore
        I have contributed in many different Opensource projects for example
        <a href="https://github.com/NickCraver/StackExchange.Exceptional" target="blank">StackExchange.Exceptional</a>,
        <a href="https://github.com/nsubstitute/NSubstitute" target="blank">NSubstitute</a> and some of the Microsoft docs, just to name a few of them.
      </p>

        You can find me on Twitter, Stack Overflow, and on GitHub.
